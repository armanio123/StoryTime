Hackathon 2019 live demo story

## #Startup
This is a demonstration of Cortana is my Dungeon Master. You will be taking on the role of Caladon, a warrior and mercenary in a medieval fantasy world. Your travels have brought you to the town of Redlake, where the locals have offered you a reward for clearing out the nearby abandoned mine of certain undesirable creatures. Are you ready to begin?

## Actions
* [yes](#GreetingRoom)
* [skip to delay](#GreetingRoom0Delay0Return)

## #GreetingRoom
You step beneath the final rotten support beam in the damp, rocky passage, and the walls open up into what remains of the staging area for the ore carts before they were loaded onto caravans for shipping to the great cities of the north. The broken and rusted remains of one of the carts leans against the wall to your right, half buried in rubble. The faint whistling of the wind passing the entrance of the mine behind you takes on a slightly deeper tone as it expands to fill this small chamber.

The space itself extends about ten feet to either side from the passageway in which you now stand. The back wall, dimly lit but still visible, stands about twice as far from you as the width of the room. Four flimsy wooden pillars support a sagging frame above, one of which remains attached only at the top, with the bottom half broken away and laying on the smooth rock floor.

A second passageway leads off into the darkness to the left, and it looks like someone has placed a makeshift door in a similar opening on the back wall.

On a small pile of stacked stones in the far right corner sits a lumpy, awkward little humanoid with oversized ears and gangly limbs, dressed only in some thin and tattered leather half-breeches. It stares thoughtlessly at its toes, twiddling them in the dust, occasionally mumbling incoherently.

The vile creature is clearly a goblin; the citizens of Redlake have offered a handful of good coin for their ears. With luck, you may be able to salvage them both!

Leaping across the room before the little brute is aware of your entry, you release your sword from its hip-sheath, and with the same motion, slash it across the monster's midsection. The goblin squeals in terror and flings itself backward into the corner, barely avoiding the tip of the blade, but knocking its head against the wall in the process.

Dazed and unstable, it wobbles on its spindly legs, trying to get its bearings while cowering in anticipation of the next inevitable blow.

## #GreetingRoom0Attack

Without waiting for the creature to regain its composure and launch a counterattack, you reverse your swing and hack downwards on the return stroke, your sword easily cutting through the ragged leather clothing and parting the thick greenish skin of the goblins legs before clanging loudly against the stone wall. Badly wounded now, the goblin collapses to the dirty floor, clutching its bloody legs and whimpering loudly. A quick thrust up and into its torso causes the blubbering to fade away quickly, until the only sound remaining is the distant whistling of the wind outside and the blood slowly dripping from your blade into a puddle below.

## #GreetingRoom0Parley

Still holding your blade aloft and ready, you stare the beast in its big yellow eyes and growl threateningly. With a submissive whimper, it leans back against the corner and slumps slowly down to the floor, carefully watching your face the whole time. Making itself as small as possible, it wraps its spindly arms around its folded legs and quietly murmurs to itself in little high-pitched monosyllabic grunts.

## #GreetingRoom0Withdraw

The pathetic creature is helpless and unarmed. You can always come back for the ears later you want to. You step away, leaving him whimpering in the corner.

You stand next to the broken support pillar, beneath the low stone ceiling and the sagging wooden frame that supposedly holds it in place. Past the goblin to your left is the makeshift door you saw earlier in the back wall. On the other side of the room is a dark passageway leading to parts unknown. Behind you is the mine's entrance, through the corridor from which you entered.
