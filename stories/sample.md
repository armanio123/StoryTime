## Intro
With every step the scent of decay and death gets stronger. The cave is dark and humid. How is that I always end in such places? -you wonder. You can still see natural light coming from some cracks on the wall, that gives you some sense of comfort. For the poorly lit places you can use your lighter, like you're doing right now.

Suddenly, you hear a noise right by your side, is sounds like heavy chains clanking. You barely see a shadowy figure resembling a human.

## #TheEnragedSkeleton
Before you even finish talking the shadowy figure launches towards you. You tried to avoid it by jumping away from his grip, but it was too close and it scratches your arm. It hurts but it is a shallow wound. 

You are surprised to see that the figure is a skeleton. A living skeleton. You spend the first seconds thinking if this is real, but soon you realize this place is not safe.

## #TheSkeleton
You move very slowly towards the shadowy figure. A strange shape on the floor grabs your attention. It's an old sword. Without focusing on the figure, you decide to pick the sword, but as soon as you hold it in your hands, the figure, who has now noticed you, makes a loud cry like nothing you have ever heard before. That thing is not from this world -you think. 
The figure launches towards you, but with the sword on your hand you're able to easily defend yourself.

More than what just happened, you are surprised to see that the figure is a skeleton. A living skeleton. You spend the first seconds thinking if this is real, but soon you realize this place is not safe. 

## #DeeperIntoTheCave
Without thinking you decide to run away from there, one of those poorly lit places is better than this darkness. Tumbling a couple times you manage to get there safely. The figure is no longer visible and you don't hear anything anymore. Looking for the lighter to improve your visibility, you notice you have dropped it during your run. After catching your breath and thinking through it, you regret losing the lighter, but that place was not safe, so you continue to think it was the best choice.

## Actions
* [Keep walking.](#TheStream)

## #TheStream
You keep thinking about the figure lingering in the darkness, crawling... each time closer... the cave is now silent, you find a stream flowing through the cave, you can see your figure distorted as the water crashes against the rocks. You see another figure on the reflection, behind you...

## Actions
* [Look back.](#IntoMadness)
  * skills: +["Madness"]
* [Keep walking.](#ThePortal)
  * skills: +["Guts"]

## #IntoMadness
You look back with anticipation, for a second you swear that a deformed version of yourself was standing in front of you, you try to dismiss the ghastly vision.

## Actions
* [Keep walking.](#ThePortal)

## #ThePortal
A light shines across the corner, you walk closer and you see what looks like an exit, you are afraid of what might be waiting beyond the light.

## Actions
* [Walk across the light.](#TheExit)
  * **skills: ["Guts"]**
* [Stand Still.](#OneWithTheDarkness)
  * **skills: ["Madness"]**

## #TheExit
You decide that you are better off facing whatever is beyond the light than staying in the cave, you walk across the portal and find yourself surrounded by a lush forest. The forest is more beautiful than anything you have ever seen before. You see a building in the distance, your journey has just started.

## #OneWithTheDarkness
You try to move, but you are overwhelmed with fear, you realize light is bad, only darkness nurtures. You start to imagine all the travelers that might try to cross this cave, you start to feel hungry, craving flesh.
