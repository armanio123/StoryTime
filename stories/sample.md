## Intro
The cave is dark and moisty, with every step the scent of decay and death gets stronger. How is that I always end in such places? -you wonder. You can still see natural light coming from some cracks on the wall, that gives you some sense of comfort. For the poorly lit places you can use your lighter, like you're doing it right now.

Suddenly, you hear a noise right by your side, is sounds like heavy chains clanking. You barely see a shadowy figure resembling a human.

## #TheEnragedSkeleton
Before you even finish talking the shadowy figure launches towards you. You tried to avoid it by jumping away from from his grip, but it was too close and it scratches your arm. It hurts but it is a shallow wound. 

You are more surprised to see that the figure is a skeleton. A living skeleton. You spend the first seconds thinking if this is real, but soon you realize this place is not safe.

## #TheSkeleton
You move very slowly towards the shadowy figure. A strange shape on the floor takes your attention. It's an old sword. Without focusing on the figure, you decide to pick the sword, but as soon as you hold it in your hand, the figure, who has now noticed you, makes a loud cry you like nothing you have heard before. That thing is not from this world -you think. 
The figure launches toward you but with the sword on your hand you're able to easily defent yourself.

More than what just happened, you are more surprised to see that the figure is a skeleton. A living skeleton. You spend the first seconds thinking if this is real, but soon you realize this place is not safe. 

## #DeeperIntoTheCave
Without thinking you decided to run away from there, one of those poorly lit places is better than this darkness. Tumbling a couple times you manage to get there safe. The figure is no longer visible and you don't hear anything anymore. Looking for the lighter to improve your visibility you just notice you have dropped it during your run. After catching your breath and thinking through it, you regret to have lost the lighter, but that place was not safe for sure. So you continue to think it was the best choice.
