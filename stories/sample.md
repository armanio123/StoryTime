## Intro
The cave is dark and moisty, with every step the scent of decay and death gets stronger. How is that I always ending in such places? -you wonder. You can still see natural light on some places on the cave, so that give you some sense of comfort. For the places where there's is barely light you can use your lighter, like you're doing it right now.

Suddenly, a noise right by your side. Like some heavy chains clanking. You can barely see a shadowy figure resembling a human.

## #TheEnragedSkeleton
Not before you even finished talking, the shadowy figure launches towards you. You tried to avoid him by jumping outside of his reach but he was too close and it was able to scratch you on the arm. It's hurts but it's not so deep. 

You are more surprised to see that the figure is a skeleton. A living skeleton. You spend the first seconds thinking if this is real but soon you release this place is not safe.

## #TheSkeleton
You move very slowly towards the shadowy figure. A strange shape on the floor takes your attention. It's an old sword. Without keeping the focus on the figure, you decided to pick the sword but as soon as you hold it in your hand the figure, who has now noticed you, makes a loud cry you have never hear before. That thing is not from this world -you think.
The figure launches toward you but with the sword on your hand you're able to easily defent yourself.

More than what just happened, you are more surprised to see that the figure is a skeleton. A living skeleton. You spend the first seconds thinking if this is real but soon you release this place is not safe. 

## #DeeperIntoTheCave
Without thinking you decided to run away from there, one of those slighly lighted places is better than this dark. Tumbling a couple times you manage to get there safe. The figure is no longer visible and you don't hear anything anymore. Looking for the lighter to improve your visibility you just noticed you must have dropped it during your run. After catching your breath and thinking through it, you regret to have lost the lighter, but for sure that place was not safe. So you continue to think it was the best choice.
